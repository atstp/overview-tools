overview-tools/
    this is the overview for `overview-tools`, hooray!

    below, you'll find the descrption of the project structure,
    what the files do, how they interact with one another, etc, etc

overview-tools/.gitignore
    the standard ignore file for git. any files and paths listed in
    here don't get tracked by version control

overview-tools/.npmignore
    on top of the `.gitignore` file, there are some extra files that
    **should** be around for development, but **should not** be around
    for production; in this project's case, those are the ECMAScript 2015
    files and the tests.

overview-tools/OVERVIEW
    the overview of the project structure, check it out to learn more!

overview-tools/README.md
    nuff said

overview-tools/bin/
overview-tools/bin/overview-tools
    this is the command line tool. It supports almost all the features
    that the node module itself supports. Commands look like this:

        ./bin/overview-tools ./OVERVIEW --to tree

    this would get you a nice, commented tree output. fancy!

overview-tools/lib/
    this directory might not be in your repo if you have the development
    version; run `npm run build` to generate it.

    It houses the ES5 that's published to npm. If you're curious about a
    specific file in it, check out that file, but in the `src/` directory
    instead.

overview-tools/package.json
overview-tools/src/
    Everything in here is ES6, woot! (on prepublish to npm, it's compiled
    to ES5 and stashed in the `lib` folder)

overview-tools/src/converters/
    this has a collection of small, single-function modules that provide
    `overview-tools`' functionality for converting to and from different
    representations.

    Each one of the files in here either goes to or from a JSON
    representation, making it convenient to convert from one format to
    another.

overview-tools/src/converters/json-to-html.js
overview-tools/src/converters/json-to-markdown.js
overview-tools/src/converters/json-to-overview.js
overview-tools/src/converters/json-to-tree.js
overview-tools/src/converters/overview-to-json.js
overview-tools/src/converters/system-to-json.js
overview-tools/src/overview-tools.js
    this file imports all the modules/functions found in `converters` and
    exports a class (by default) and an object with all the functions.

    Basically, it packages up things in a friendly manor: A class for OOP
    fans and a collection of functions for Erlang-ians and Haskell-ites.

overview-tools/test/
    mocha and chai tests, their naming is pretty straightforward; each one
    matches a specific file from `src`

overview-tools/test/json-to-html.js
overview-tools/test/json-to-overview.js
overview-tools/test/json-to-tree.js
overview-tools/test/overview-to-json.js
overview-tools/test/system-to-json.js
